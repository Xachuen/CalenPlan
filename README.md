Hello! This is my first ever Web Dev project. To get started, you need to make your own .env.local file for all API keys.
Copy and paste the lines **WITHIN** the brackets to said file, and replace the comments "//" and everything that follows
until the end of the line.

VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=//Create a clerk account for this.
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=//Create a clerk account for this. Should be the same as ^^^.
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=//Create a clerk account for this.
VITE_SERVER_URL=//This is your backend URL.
VITE_MAPBOX_KEY=//Create a MapBox account for this.
DATABASE_URL=//Create and use your MONGODB database URL.
